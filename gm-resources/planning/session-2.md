# Adversary Space

## Session 2

### Synopsis

The PCs return to Agradum with Core refugees from the Ifsen Gate Station. After debriefing the refugees, they have to decide what to do about the blight on Ifsen Solus. The Rebel Leaders who started the blight there have all disappeared, presumably killed or subjected to rendition during the last Core assault.

**Alternate adventure:** PCs could go to Gussy's Scrap Pile in Aquo Koloa to try and buy another prototype of the fleet-mounted pentalaser. The deal will go south, interrupted by All forces intent on recapturing the tech. After Combat, there will be an Evasion scene to get out of the market - stay one step ahead of the All company descending on the market. Then PCs will have to Crew their way past the blockade and back out of the system.

### Scene 1

Ship time.

The PCs must decide to take the refugees to Fomes Argentum or the Silver Cradle to debrief their pasdsengers and deliver their score from Hidasta.

Skip-Jack leaves the crew to go call in some favors that might help the crew solve the problem on Ifsen Solus.

### Scene 2

Intrigue.

The PCs can debrief one of the Core bureaucrats left behind of Ifsen Gate Station.

Remind thePCs that:

- Rebel leaders started a genetic wasting disease on Ifsen Prime to destroy its crops.
- They hoped to driveout the All's forces.
- They held the cure.
- At the same time, the All began a purge of rebels, striking at Ifsen Solus and the guerilla fleet in Ifsen's Maze from the Broken Hearth space station.
- The rebel leaders scattered, or were killed, or were captured and rendered to Benevolent Isolation in Novarum.
- If the PCs want to help Ifsen Solus, they'll need to find the leaders and get the cure or off-switch for the wasting disease.

Ask each PC a question from the list below to help create the character they're going to question.

- Who were you surprised to find left behind on that station? What's their name?
- What was their job in Ifsen?
- What was their tell? How did you know to pick them out from the other refugees for questioning?
- How deeply involved were they with the last purge of rebels in the system?

The big problem is that the All tried to disappear the rebels and their leaders and then fled once they detected the genetic wasting disease. They did not leave a paper trail on purpose, at first, and then in their panic, second.

Then, **if the PCs are on the Silver Cradle**, they should have a machine learning warrior contact who can hook the bureaucrat up to a wild VR rig to visualize his thinking.

PCs can narrate what kind of space his thoughts become and how the environment changes or fills with threats or things they try to distract themselves and not think of answers. This can be a kind of exploration of spaces in a memory cathedral rather than an interrogation. It cannot be torture or the machine learning warrior will pull the plug. The PCs should have fun narrating this without causing harm.

**If the PCs are on Fomes Argentum**, they can use the humans' advanced technology to interface with the bureaucrat's brain and the bureaucrat both at once, so to speak, getting different answers from both as the bureaucrat tries to slow their thoughts, and their thoughts rush to answer questions for dopamine hits. The PCs should have fun narrating this.

Things the PCs may learn:

- Many rebels were killed; it's not known who among them were leaders.
- A few ships escaped the rebel fleet, but rather than run the blockade at Ifsen Gate, they disappeared into the wreackge of Shattered Shields.
- All prisoners were taken to Benevolent Isolation in the occupied Novarum system - a cloud of wreackge left over from the fall of Novarum that the All welded into a tumbling prison.

### Scene 3

Crew.

Regardless of where they go, when the PCs jump out of their next gate, there are 2 All frigates waiting for them. 

"Void Treader, shut down your drive, lower your shields, and prepare to be boarded. You will be taken into custody for an attack on an All diplomatic shuttle in the Ifsen system. Your compliance with this directive will earn you a merciful sentencing to Benevolent Isolation. If you do not comply, we will be forced to fire on your ship. You must also declare any contraband on board, such as machine learning warriors, or face the severest of consequences. Do you comply?"

PCs might:

- Fight back.
- Escape.
- Agree to be taken into custody to get into Benevolent Isolation if they learned that rebel leaders from Ifsen Solus might be there.

This could also become a combat scene if the PCs want to agree to be boarded. Or they couldeven invite the frigate(s) to dock with their cargo container airlock and then drop it and escape like a space-lizard.

### Scene 4

Combat.

**If the PCs go to Shattered Shields**, they will find an All frigate landed on a space hulk, its crew engaged in a scrap-to-scrap firefight with defending rebels who are evacuating a disabled ship. The PCs can land and join the fight.

Afer the fight, the rebels will ask the PCs for help repairing their ship. They were trying to leave the system and break their leaders. out of Benevolent Isolation in Novarum when the All frigate, which must have been a sleeper left on silent running since the last purge, came to life and attacked before they could leave the debris field.

**If the PCs go to Novarum,** once the PCs are processed into Benevolent Isolation or once they land their on their own, a group of prisoners who used to be murderous space pirates from the Far Reach nebula in Aquo Koloa will recognize Stinky Pete and accost him intending to humiliate and beat him for promising to throw a space-tractor race that he won instead.

"That bet cost us everything! Outer Rim Productions took our ships, and when we went back for them, they had the All throw us in prison!"

After the fight, win or lose, the pirates will consider the debt settled, unless Rebis maims them, and join in solidarity with the PCs as prisoners.

### What happens next?

All signs point towards Benevolent Isolation in Novarum. The PCs. must infiltrate the prison and break out the rebel leaders from Ifsxen who can end the genetic wasting disease destroying its crops.

**Alternate adventure:** The PCs could undertake anothert episodic caper like the one on Aquo Koloa.

### Rewards

At the end of the session, Skip-Jack shows up in a shuttle. "I bring gifts," he says, "and a whole lot of money." He's brought a cargo container's worth of All credits to bribe your way through Novarum or buy prototype weapons or whatever else the PCs need.

The gifts are breaks. Each PC can choose something Skip-Jack might get them based on their relationships and the time they've spent together so far in the campaign.
