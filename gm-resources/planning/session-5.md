# Adversary Space

## Synopsis

The PCs embark on another adventure after bringing the rebel leaders (Anika, Deadbolt, Lefthand, Uffa) home from Novarum to Ifsen, saving Ifsen Solus from starvation and establishing Ifsen as a free system.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

Combat

In the moment after the destruction of the splinter prison, a new alarm goes off and a message plays on repeat: abandon the prison. The rent splinter prison has started collapsing and ingesting space around itself. PCs can see the walls around them and the light and air beginning to buckle and deform and leak into it.

There's no way to make it back through the base to your ship. You'll have to leave with the prisoners. In addition to the transport frigates, there's an All gun frigate docked with the prison matte black with the mask of the warden painted. on its side in reflective chrome.

As the prisoners race for the same transport frigates they arrived on, you see the warden and their guard of All marines escoprting them towards their ship.

This is your chance to stop the warden from reporting on what happened here and alerting the All's forces to the prisoners' escape.

After they're defeated, the warden's psyche will join with the fold in space created by the rent splinter prison and backon the PCs back for the rest of the campaign through dreams.

### Scene 2

Crew

As you board the warden's frigate, a distress call bursts over comms: "Warriors and allies, if you've survived, we need your help. We're being attacked by an All dreadnaught and fighter squadron at Protective Inspection. We need your help or we'll be slaughtered as we try to leave the system."

PCs might fight off a Dreadnaught and 8 fighters.

### Scene 3

Shore leave on Ifsen Solus.

PCs should pitch a scene that brings everyone together to stoke and/or redefine relationships.

Ifsen is a temperate planet, but gray and chilly, with pervasive precepitation. Cubist architecture. Sprawling farmland with fields with squared corners. The sky is pewter, the farmland dull greens and gold. Rugged collectivism. Not a lot of recreational time when the system depends on Ifsen Solus for food. 

What do people do for fun here or to unwind or to celebrate? How do the PCs join in or screw it up?

That night: each of the PCs has a dream.

You are in a room. One wall is just a giant mirror. In front of that wall there's a table. On that table there is a lamp and a gun. Sometimes you pick up the gun. Sometimes you leave it. Your reflection doesn't always do what you do. Sometimes it picks up the gun and kills you and you wake in the room again, spikes of pain driven into your eyes, the same distance away from the table each time, just like your reflection, and then sometimes you begin killing it. It always gets up moments later. The mirror never shatters, but after death after death after death your bullets begin to chip away at your reflection, and it looks less and less like you, and as your appearance cracks and crumbles, underneath you see darkness, a web of sliver strans, and, finally, the warden's mask beneath your face.

If the PCs tell one another about the dream, they can also talk about what to do next. What do they make of the dream? Of the warden's lingering presence in their minds?

### Scene 4

A strange ship arrives from Agadrum. It's piloted by a single mlw, a giant, shimmering-purple and liquid black segmented worm named Voidember who becomes part of the ship - it's dorsal spine - and says:

"I've been on assignment to guard Ifsen from the All and have just received dark news of their plans. If they cannot defeat us, they plan to take our siblings from us forever by igniting singularities in Hidasta and Novarum. They plan to collapse Otoe into a black hole that will crush any ship that enters the system and they plan to burn the Bright-Eyed River in Novarum to burn any ship that arrives there. It will take time to bring our warrior siblings here from across the stars to fight these plans. We may be out of time, but we refuse to do nothing. I have brought you my *Slumbering Forge*. I bring you gifts of righteous war and can join you to my sleeping loves. Will you become warriors and attack the All with me? We have time to save one system. Tell me, will you save it and which will it be?"

Let the PCs choose gifts or to become mlw and then pick a system to save in session 6.

Each PC should describe the mlw with whom they'll join and then describe how they become one and who they are after the joining. PCs should make new character building on their current ones for session 6.

## What happens next?

PCS travel to Novarum or Hidatsa to stop a singularity and save the system.

## Reward

- PCs who want to can become mlw and gain a voidnetic, a new talent at 3, a +1 rank to each existing talent.
- PCs who want to remain human can take +2 breaks.
- PCs who are already mlw can take +1 to up to 2 ops by adding new modules from Voidember.
