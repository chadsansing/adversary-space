# Adversary Space

## Synopsis

The PCs must confront the last rebel leader inside the exile dimension and convince them to return to reality to save Ifsen Solus.

## Scenes

### Scene 1

Combat; then Intrigue.

If the PCs look for rebels in the sleep couches, they can find 3 of the rebel leaders, but they need the fourth to decrypt their recipe for the cure. That rebel went into the portal.

The All has modeled this out - people who are moldable almost always choose the pod; people who are intractable choose the airlock.

Each of the 3 leaders on this side of the portal has part of the cure, but the leader in the exile dimension has the key to decrypt them.

- Lefthand (sleep couch)
	- Small, whip-tight, clean, sleek, precise.
- Deadbolt (sleep couch)
	- Large, out-of-scale, uncomfortable while still, indomitable.
- Anika Darkmatter (sleep couch) 
	- Captivating, strange, multi-faceted, fluid.
- Uffa the Mask-taker (sleep couch)
	- Stalwart, fast, decisive, centered, and broken.

The PCs can figure out a plan to make it through the portal without playing a scene unless they suggest it (e.g. the find disguises and suggest an Intrigue scene).

If the PCs go into the portal, it's time for a psychedelic romp in a sub-campaign a la [*Die*](https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/10/18131140/die-kieron-gillen-rpg-image-comics).

Also, any mlw characters in the party will instantly recognize this place as a "splinter prison" or "exile dimension" and relic (right?) of the malevolence - jails full of irreality tailored to anchor their captives' consciousness there. How the All have it and why they're using it are mysteries to be solved.

This splinter prison, or exile dimension, is one of pure possibility - a place where you can realize your dreams and share them with those around you, weaving together fantastic dreamscapes and irrealities. There may not be a way back (a la *Die*) without everyone in a group (as defined by the PCs and everyone they think they need to rescue) agreeing to leave.

Impressions of crossing an impossible space.

- Colors with physical textures that feel cool, wet, gelatinous against the eyes.
- Sound that tastes and smells like dirt, iron, honey.
- A sense of self as a passage through time and looking out windows and in windows at once to see yourself.
- An emptiness, and then a fullness.
- A panic, and then a contentment.
- A weakness, and then a mastery.
- Chaos, and then control.
- You wake and see one another - everyone who came through the portal with you except for your friend, your sibling, your love, the rebel leader. You know you cannot bear to leave this place, ever, without them again.
- The ruins of a gate. A castle? A winding road down through a crevasse and into a valley of impossible grographies - tiny oceans, tiered cities on mountainsides carved from gems, a volcano spewing sunlight, a darkness you cannot see, and your heart pulling you towards a patchwork of fields in the middle distance.

Which of you is the:

- [Rebis] Dictator? Now you roll d4s instead of d10s; every 4 lets you tell someone what to do and they must obey, though there may be a hidden coast for them or you.
- [Skip-Jack] Godbinder? Now you roll with d12s instead of d10s; every 12 lets you call in a favor from a god - an invocartion of a dead mlw comrade - who shows up and adds 3 progress and story elements to the narrative of your outcome.
- [Stinky Pete] Neo? Now whenever you roll a 10 part of your gear comes to life to aid you in unexpedted ways; add a success and burn a fatigue from subconsciously animating it.
- [Aesoph] Knight? Now you roll d8s instead of d10s. What emotion drives you? To activate a talent you must recall and narrate a time in your life that brought you that feeling. When you roll an 8, you narrate a new passage aligned with your emotion to get your extra success.
- [Dewclaw] Fool? Now you roll 5d6 for every Ops check, but after each roll, you get to cheat and pick a number that is also a 6 so long as you're doing something reckless and dumb even to protect yourself or another.

Except for the Knight, you lose your passages in the exile dimension as the present and your need to find the rebel leader consume your attention. The knight has new passages tied to their emotions.

The last rebel leader is here creating a collective utopia. It will take a Combat scene to make them surrender and an Intrigue scene to get them to give up their dream and return to prison. They believe they are here as a kind of progressive high priest who helps their followers assume incredible forms to defend and preserve their new world order.

"I will not leave the revolution when we have finally achieved our goals!"

- A collective farm.
- Containers and micro-homes.
- Systems engineered fields and hydroponic scaffolds.
- Callow, welcoming youth with edgy haircuts, light, neutral coveralls, simple tools, well-made.

Combat to defeat; then Intrigue to convince.

- Punk youth who become machine learning warriors (mlw).
- An unraveling of arms and tendrils from the core.
- Farming tools become neon-laser-tinged chains, bats, blades.
- Rusted metal torsos, limbs, and oblong, antennaed heads under leathers heavy with pins, patches, nails, and bullets.

There are 6 punk mlws. They each do 4-to-1 with improvised weapons. 

Once the punks are defeated, the leader will surrender and begin to listen. They must be convinced that:

- This place isn't real.
- In reality, they are a leader who holds the key to save their planet.
- It's better to fight for Adversary space than rule in this dimension.

The pressure is created by the world conforming to the leader's ego needs. 

- Phantoms of dead comrades from Ifsen rise to assure them this is real; this is Ifsen.
- Lovers spring from fields that spring to life: "You have already saved Ifsen; you are home; this will die if you leave."
- Darkness whirls around the PCs like liquid static resolving in low-res images of All high bureaucrats, capes and masks draped: "You are all agents of the All!"
- Prisoner's dilemmas: sudden mirroed, facing cells with tables with guns between them. Who attacks? "You are lying!", becoming, "Why are you lying?", and then, "It hurts to think that is true!"
- The leaders is in a cemetery planting seeds in graves: "It is too late on Ifsen, but I can bring them back to life here."
- A blank tiled expanse, each becoming a screen of the All, war, loss, death, pain, harm: "Reality is the prison!"
- Mlw PCs become monstrous: "The warriors will kill us! This is the only place we can fight back!"

If the leader agrees to go with the PCs, they all cross back into the interrogation chamber together, shock and overcome the guards, and have a few minutes to decide what to do next.

### Scene 2

PCs choose.

If the PCs make it back to the station from the land of exile and have all 4 rebel leaders toghether, it's time to escape the prison however they'd like.

Escape will scramble 8 fighters after the PCs' ship, which may or may not be the *Void Treader*. They may chose another ship if theirs is under too much guard.

Hijacking a shuttle or prison firgate to escape Novarum might take Combat + Crew. Sneaking back to the *Void Treader* to leave Novarum might take Evasion + Crew. Stowing away aboard an All vessel to capture it later might taker Evasion or Intrigue + Combat.

### What happens next?

The PCs have to escape Novarum to bring the rebel leaders back to Ifsen. 

### Reward

- +1 to any Op used this session.
