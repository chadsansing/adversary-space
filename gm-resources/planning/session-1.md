# Adversary Space

## Session 1

### Synopsis

Machine learning warriors and their human allies discover the truth behind the All's flight from an occupied system.

### Scene 0

- TL;DR your character.
- 3 cool things about your system.

### Scene 1

Ship time. 

The PCs have just pulled off a major score in Hidatsa. They've been planning, jumping, stealing, and running for 10 weeks straight. They're groggy, a little tired of each other's company, and eager to get off ship. 

They're just about to drop out of hyperspace in Agradum, the capital of the old resistance against the malevolence and the modern-day capital of machine learning warriors's cultural life. They're waking up and gathering in the galley for one last cup of coffee and one more bowl of mush.

- **Stinky Pete**, what did you rob from the All's on Hidatsa, and why did it matter so much?
- **Skip-Jack**, who did you have to shiv with your vibroblade when no one was looking to make sure the mission was a success?
- **Dewclaw**, who do you know here? Why do you want to catch up with them? What's the last thing you heard about their adventures?
- **Aesoph**, which of those street kids back on the Arikara ringworld in Hidatsa stood out as your next recruit?
- **Rebis**, who caused you the most anxiety and fear with their reckless human impulses on that last mission? What did they do?

Once PCs have a chance to answer each question, ask them to set their relationships for one another for this session.

The *Void Treader* drops out into Agadrum space. PCs can breathe easy. The biggest decision they have to make is whether they want to go to the Silver Cradle (mind-bending machine learning warrior alt-reality R&R) or Fomes Argentum (human techno-utopia meets planetary preserve) first.

As they're about to make their decision, Dewclaw's friend pings the ship from the station at Agadrum gate. After a brutal push to supress rebel resistance in Ifsen and to push the guerilla fleet out of Ifsen's Maze, the All is abandoning the system entirely, and we don't know why. Ifsen's fleet is licking its wounds - they have no interdiction capacity left. We need you to turn around, go to Ifsen, and intercept any All ship remaining in the sector before they all escape. Find out why they're leaving and what they'd done.

Let the PCs ask questions and improv the answers together to add to Ifsen's lore.

### Scene 2

Crew.

Once the PCs exit in Ifsen, they get a message from the guerilla fleet in Ifsen's Maze. The last ship out of Broke Hearth, an All diplomatic shuttle with a small fighter escort, is making a break through Ifsen's Maze for the wormhole. They've been told not to engage and to await your arrival. 

The PCs can enter the asteroid field at Chop 4 an attempt to force the ship down on to a large asteroid to board it and gather intel. They can also wait for the ship to clear the field and try to intercept it at Chop 3 between the maze and the wormhole, but they'll only have 2 turns to disable the ship before it flees for Novarum, the nearest occupied sector by wormhole.

Once the ship is disbled and forced to land on an asteroid or the wormhole station, the PCs an attempt to board.

If they land on the station, it's eerily empty - the remaining people are without hope and might surround the PC and All's ships to demand passage after the next few scenes.

### Scene 3

Combat.

The PCs have to figh past 2 fire teams of All marines to reach the bridge of the ship where an undersecretary for agriculture and a pair of lackeys are hiding from battle. 

The marines, armed with vibroswords and assault rifles, are masked in sensor lids and wearing hardened body armor. 

The officials are unmasked and have dark gray half-capes over plain black uniforms. 

### Scene 4

Intrigue.

The PCs need to know why the All is fleeing Ifsen.

- Rebel leaders started a genetic blight on Ifsen Solus. 
- It's clearly human-made.
- The All didn't do it so far as everyone knew.
- We decided to leave to avoid blame for the humanitarian catastrophe about to happen. 
- We don't know how to stop it.
- The people don't know what's happening. We kept tight control over food production on Ifsen Solus.
- We just killed scores of rebels and captured dozens more and sent them to Benevolent Isolation in Novarum.
- We don't keep records of rebels, only new citizens.

### What happens next?

- The PCs need to decide what to do about the people who want off of Ifsen Gate Station if scenes 3 and 4 happen there.
- The PCs need to decide what to do about Ifsen and how to pursue the leads they got from their prisoners. They also need to decide what to do with their prisoners.

### Rewards

PCs can pick 1:

- A combat break from the defeated marines.
- An intrigue break from interrogated officials.
- A crew break from scavenging the All diplomatic shuttle or the Ifsen Gate Station.
